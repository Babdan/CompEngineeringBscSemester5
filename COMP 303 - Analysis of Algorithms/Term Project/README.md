# Tower of Hanoi Solver (Version 1)

This Tower of Hanoi Solver is the first version created by Group 3, including Bogdan Itsam Dorantes-Nikolaev, Ahmet Yasir Beydili, Sena Gungormez, and Doruk Gungormez.

### Overview
This program solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using both recursive and iterative algorithms. It offers a simple graphical interface built with Tkinter.

### Features
- **Recursive Algorithm**: Utilizes recursive logic to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
- **Iterative Algorithm**: Implements an iterative approach for Tower of Hanoi problem-solving.
- **User Interface**: Provides a graphical user interface to input the number of discs and select the solving algorithm.

### How to Use
1. Choose the solving algorithm (Recursive or Iterative).
2. Enter the number of discs.
3. Click on "Run Algorithm" to initiate the solving process.
4. The program displays the total movements and runtime in the interface.

### Known Issues (Version 1)
- **No Threading**: The program runs on a single thread, affecting the accuracy of the timer's readings.

### Future Improvements
- Address the timer accuracy issue by implementing threading.
- Enhance user experience with additional features or optimizations.

### Usage
To run the program:
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Execute the script `tower_of_hanoi.py`.
