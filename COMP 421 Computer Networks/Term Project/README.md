# Project Title
UDP Game Application

## Description
This application is a network-based game that demonstrates UDP (User Datagram Protocol) communication using Python. Developed with Tkinter for the user interface and sockets for network communication, it features a rich set of network-related functionalities. Key features include:
- **Timeout Duration Setting**: Customize the duration after which a timeout is triggered if no response is received.
- **Manual Mode and Auto Mode**: Choose between manual operation for step-by-step control and auto mode for automatic gameplay.
- **Timeout and Retransmission**: The game handles packet loss by implementing timeout detection and packet retransmission, showcasing real-world network handling.
- **Points System**: Engage in competitive gameplay with a points-based system that tracks players' performance.
